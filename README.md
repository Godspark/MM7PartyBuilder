# MM7PartyBuilder
This project helps Might & Magic VII: For Blood and Honor players create a party, by setting some constraints on the party.

In version 1.0, players can only use the following constraint: At least one party member with skill X, and at least Y mastery.
In other words, if one wants a party able to achieve at least the following skills:
- Air Magic (Grandmaster)
- Spear (Master)
- Body Magic (Grandmaster)
- Alchemy (Grandmaster)
The program would list the following two party combinations, (which are the only two combinations fulfilling the requirements):
- Knight, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer
- Archer, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer

Upcoming features:
- Setting the same skill twice will mean that at least two party members need to have the skill.
- The ability to set individual classes as requirements (e.g. In this party I want at least one Knight).
- The ability to set groups of classes as requirements (e.g. In this party I want at least one Knight OR one Paladin)
- The ability to set groups of skills and mastery as requirements (e.g. In this party I want at least one member with Sword(Master), Mace(Grandmaster) or Axe(Master)
