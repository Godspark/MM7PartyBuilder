# MM7PartyBuilder
This project helps Might & Magic VII: For Blood and Honor players create a party, by setting some constraints on the party.

Players can use a set of constraints to set how many characters should have which skills. E.g. At least one party member with skill X, and at least Y mastery.
In other words, if one wants a party able to achieve at least the following skills:
- At least 1 with Air Magic (Grandmaster)
- At least 1 with Spear (Master)
- At least 1 with Body Magic (Grandmaster)
- At least 1 with Alchemy (Grandmaster)
The program will list the following two party combinations, (the only combinations fulfilling the requirements):
- Knight, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer
- Archer, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer

Changelog since start
- Added the following numbering filters: None, At least (1,2,3), Exactly (1,2,3), All



Upcoming features:
- The ability to set individual classes as requirements (e.g. In this party I want at least one Knight).
- The ability to set groups of classes as requirements (e.g. In this party I want at least one Knight OR one Paladin)
- The ability to set groups of skills and mastery as requirements (e.g. In this party I want at least one member with Sword(Master), Mace(Grandmaster) or Axe(Master)
